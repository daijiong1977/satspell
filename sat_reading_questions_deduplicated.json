The microgenre of electronic music known as hyperpop emerged in the 2010s, with American musician Laura Les as an early exponent.

In a commodity money economy, specific goods act as a common unit of monetary exchange that can be used to buy and sell other goods. In a barter economy, goods are traded directly between parties without the use of money. Economists Bruce Champ and Scott Freeman: bartering requires that \u201cthe person with whom you wish to trade must not only have what you want but also want what you have. The inefficiency is apparent; a great deal of time is spent merely finding someone with whom to trade.\u201d Champ and Freeman: when \u201cindividuals might come to accept one particular good in exchange for others even if they do not wish to consume that good...barter economies essentially become monetary economies.\u201d The student wants to paraphrase a quotation from Champ and Freeman to explain the inefficiency of barter economies.",

So in one day, a humpback whale weighing 30,000 kg could eat 9,000 kg, while a southern right whale weighing 80,000 kg could ingest a whopping 24,000 kg. Over the last century, baleen whale populations have declined, and contrary to some scientists\u2019 expectations, so have krill populations. Matthew S. Savoca and colleagues resolve this apparent discrepancy by pointing out that baleen whales cycle iron in the ocean, helping support phytoplankton populations, which, in turn, sustain krill populations.",

Slater and Mann call for more research on this discrepancy between tropical and temperate female birdsong.\nText 2\nRecent evidence shows that a female Cassin's finch is as capable of song as a male is. In fact, female birdsong is more common among temperate species than currently assumed, claim Evangeline Rose and colleagues.

Conversely, Myrmotherula guttata (the rufous-bellied antwren), with which M. fusca shares territory in French Guiana, practices foliage gleaning (picking insects off leaves), substantially limiting the bird's field of vision while foraging.

As the boreal climate has warmed in recent decades, however, common knotgrass (Polygonum aviculare) plants have established themselves in Alaska. It has been suggested that warming-induced delays in the onset of subfreezing temperatures in autumn can benefit invasives more than native species; to evaluate this possibility, biologists Christa Mulder and Katie Spellman tracked V. edule and P. aviculare, along with other native and invasive species, over several years, concluding that invasives are advantaged by delays in subfreezing temperature onset in Alaska.",

However, countries do not all use the same number; for example, Greenland uses a minimum population of 200, while the Netherlands uses 20,000. Other countries use a combination of population and other factors. This variation makes it difficult for researchers to compare aspects of urbanization in different countries.Text 2 Recently, a group of six international organizations developed global definitions of common types of settlements.

By contrast, jaguars have a somewhat flexible hyoid, and the bone is attached to the skull with a stretchy ligament that rusty-spotted cats lack.

    "passage": "Text 1: For decades, ornithologists assumed that if they saw a singing Bell's vireo\u2014a bird species found in temperate North American\u2014they must be observing a male. That's because birdsong has long been considered a male trait; researchers have argued that males to attract mates and claim territory. Text 2: Recent evidence shows that a female Bell's vireo is as capable of song as a male is. In fact, Karan J. Odom and colleagues found evidence of female song in 71% of the 323 species they examined. They claim that the historical mischaracterization of birdsong as a male trait is largely the result of bias: much of the research ornithologists have carried out has been near universities in the temperate northern hemisphere, where female birdsong is less common than it is in the tropics.",

As Peter J.B. Slater and Nigel I. Mann have emphasized, however, a similar assumption can't be made about birds in the tropics, where females sing as often as males do. Slater and Mann call for more research on this discrepancy between tropical and temperate female birdsong.\n\nText 2\nRecent evidence shows that a female Cassin's finch is as capable of song as a male is. In fact, female birdsong is more common among temperate species than currently assumed, claim Evangeline Rose and colleagues. These female songbirds sing less frequently than males do, and in duller tones, making it \"easy for researchers to miss the quiet and hidden females and focus on the loud and colorful males,\" says Rose.",
