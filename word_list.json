As Peter J.B. Slater and Nigel I. Mann have emphasized, however, a similar assumption can't be made about birds in the tropics, where females sing as often as males do. Slater and Mann call for more research on this discrepancy between tropical and temperate female birdsong.\nText 2\nRecent evidence shows that a female Cassin's finch is as capable of song as a male is. In fact, female birdsong is more common among temperate species than currently assumed, claim Evangeline Rose and colleagues. These female songbirds sing less frequently than males do, and in duller tones, making it \"easy for researchers to miss the quiet and hidden females and focus on the loud and colorful males,\" says Rose.",

So in one day, a pygmy right whale weighing 3,500 kg could eat 1,050 kg, while a bowhead whale weighing 66,000 kg could ingest a whopping 19,800 kg. Over the last century, baleen whale populations have declined, and contrary to some scientists' expectations, so have krill populations. Matthew S. Savoca and colleagues resolve this apparent discrepancy by pointing out that baleen whales cycle iron in the ocean, helping support phytoplankton populations, which, in turn, sustain krill populations.",

This structure, which the team named Nadir, exhibits all the telltale signs of a high-velocity impact crater: an elevated rim, a circular shape, a terraced floor, and a pronounced area of uplift at its center.\n\nText 2\nBoth carbonate dissolution and subsurface salt withdrawal can cause craterlike depressions without the need for a high-velocity impact. However, carbonate dissolution is very unlikely to have occurred in the vicinity of Nadir, and although subsurface salt withdrawal could have plausibly occurred in this area and would result in a depression with a terraced floor or a circular shape, it would not exhibit the area of central uplift seen at Nadir.",

It's a term created by British and Portuguese colonizers to refer to the myriad spiced sauces with ties to the Indian subcontinent. In 1973, chef Madhur Jaffrey dismissed the term \"curry\" as inaccurate, and in 2021 blogger Nisha Vedi Pawar suggested that people abandon the term both for its colonial origin and for its failure to grasp the intricacies of India's cuisines. Text 2 Growing up in India, chef Chintan Pandya didn't encounter the term \"curry\" often: his family didn't cook curries, but some of his neighbors did. Although the blanket use of the term is rooted in colonialism, Pandya calls some of his dishes curries. Having traveled throughout India as part of his training, he came to appreciate the country's diverse cuisines and the diverse uses of the term \"curry.\"",

The most enduring example of this idea is Margaret Wise\nBrown\u2019s 1947 picture book Goodnight Moon, in which a young rabbit names the objects in his room as he drifts off to\nsleep. Scholars note that the book\u2019s emphasis on repetition, rhythm, and nonsense rhyme speaks directly to Mitchell\u2019s\ninfluence.",

While people who pursue other art forms\u2014sculpture, architecture, long form prose\u2014require large blocks of uninterrupted time as well as money to complete their work, poets can write, as Lorde said, \"between shifts, in the hospital pantry, on the subway, and on scraps of surplus paper.\" So poets can make worthwhile art even if they must earn their living in another way. Text 2 Any assessment of the state of contemporary poetry must reckon with the professionalization of the field. While it is possible in theory for anyone to publish in Virginia Quarterly Review, Kenyon Review, or a similar major poetry outlet, many people who do so have professional training in poetry and extensive practice writing it, which requires time not often available to those who must also work full-time jobs.

Ekvall and colleagues found that WC-NPs can accumulate in the bodies of water lice (Asellus aquaticus). While bioaccumulation of manufactured nanoparticles may be inherently worrisome, it has been hypothesized that WC-NP bioaccumulation in invertebrates like A. aquaticus could serve a valuable proxy role, obviating the need for manufacturers to conduct costly and intrusive sampling of vertebrate species such as Perez's frogs (Pelophylax perezi), commonly used in regulatory compliance testing\u2014for nanoparticle bioaccumulation, as environmental protection laws currently require.",
